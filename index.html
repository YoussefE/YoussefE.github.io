		<h3 class="title">ABOUT ME</h3>
		<p class="text">
			Based in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Ottawa,Ontario" target="_blank">Ottawa, ON</a> programming has been a passion
			of mine since the early days of high school. Growing up, math was always my favorite subject because I truly enjoyed the
			problem solving aspect and the rewarding feeling of solving a challenging question. Programming really brought together
			the aspects I loved about math and added an element of creativity and ingenuity to the mix.
